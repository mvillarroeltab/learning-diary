I finished the FAC 'Comment box' project. With a background in architecture and design, for me the asthetic and user experience is as important as the functionality (even though I know this exercise was more about entering the javascript world).

I used css 'flex' to make the form behave in the way that I wanted it to and a colour palette that I have used previously for titles, fonts etc. I had a bit of trouble getting the 'submit' button to center while the rest of the items align to he right or left but in the end I managed. I did a bit of research about structuring forms and found out that good practise is to put them inside html lists or <div>.

Rgarding the javascript file, once I figured out how I wanted the info to appear in the web (via a paragraph element) then I had no trouble with the counting function itself or the one to alert the user about exceeding the character count. I spent loads of time on the one to show the comments on the web (via a <div> below the form). I wanted the name to appear next to the comment so I have done this with flex as well, but they are unconfortably close. I have not used arrays for this.. yet?

Today I started the FAC 'Movie-Data' repository and added the FAC object to the js file.
